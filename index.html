          <p>Released in 1987, the Nike Air Max 1 was designed by legendary designer Tinker Hatfield. 
            Air had been used prior to the Air Max 1, but it was always hidden behind foam. 
            Inspired by a trip to Paris and a visit to the Pompidou Center, 
            Hatfield took his thoughts about the glass building back to Oregon: 
            “Maybe we could also expose the Air-Sole technology and create a shoe that’s like no other.” The rest is history.

          <p>The Nike Air Max 90 symbolized the start of a new decade. 
            The design was fresh and indicative to where the brand wanted to go. 
            Expectations for the Air Max 90 were high and designer Hatfield knew the silhouette would hit the ground running, 
            so the sneaker was designed to evoke forward motion.
             With its fluid aesthetic, the Air Max 90 featured a larger volume Air unit than its predecessors 
             and popularized the color that would become known as “infrared.”</p>

          <p>The Nike Air Max 95 wasn’t just a sneaker. 
            Nike itself describes the shoe as an “outcast.” 
            The model was the first silhouette to feature visible Air in the forefoot. 
            The element brought a whole new approach to cushioning and support. Designer Sergio Lozano was greatly inspired by the human body. 
            Thus elements that resemble human ribs, vertebrae, muscles and skin were incorporated into the design.</p>

          <p>Like the 95, the Nike Air Max 97 broke ground. 
            The model featured the first full-length Max Air unit. 
            A feature that brought 360 degrees of comfort and opened tons of doors for design and innovation. 
            Designed by Christian Tresser, the silhouette for the Air Max 97 was directly inspired by Japan’s high-speed bullet trains. 
            The result was a fast and fluid design. At a time when music, movies and style mattered most, the 97 was the perfect shoe for the era.</p>

          <p>The first of its kind, the Nike Air Max 270 was the first model to boast an Air unit 100-percent designed for lifestyle. 
            So it was built to stand up to the rigors of sport as well as the demands of all-day wear. 
            Its design was inspired by the Nike Air Max 93 and the Nike Air Max 180. With the former also inspiring the name for the new model. 
            As 270 stems from an internal Nike epithet for the Air Max 93 that referred to 
            270 degrees of visibility in the air unit. At the time of its release 
            it also featured the tallest-ever Air Max heel unit, at 32-mm tall.</p>
